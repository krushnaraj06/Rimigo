# Rimigo - Premium Travel Website

A modern travel website built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CS About the Design

When building Rimigo, I wanted to keep things simple yet visually appealing. The goal was to create a website that feels premium without being overwhelming - something that lets the destinations speak for themselves.

# My Design Approach

I focused on clean layouts with plenty of breathing room. Instead of cramming everything together, I used white space strategically to guide the eye and make the experience feel more relaxed. The animations are subtle - they're there to add polish, not to distract.

For typography, I mixed elegant cursive fonts for accents with clean sans-serif for readability. This combination gives the site a sophisticated feel while keeping everything easy to read.

# What I Was Going For

**Visual Impact**  
I wanted users to feel transported the moment they land on the site. That's why I used large, immersive hero images and bold typography on the destination pages. The Instagram-style gallery section adds authenticity by showcasing real travel moments.

**Smooth Experience**  
Navigation needed to feel effortless. I implemented smooth scrolling, a floating navbar that adapts as you scroll, and glass morphism effects for that modern, premium touch. All animations are powered by GSAP to keep things buttery smooth.

**Emotional Connection**  
Travel is emotional, so I tried to capture that through inspirational copy, authentic photography, and real testimonials. Each destination page has its own personality with unique color themes and carefully curated content.

# Desktop-Optimized Viewing

I should mention - this website is best experienced on desktop. While it works on mobile, I optimized everything for larger screens (1920x1080 and above) because that's where the design really shines.

Why desktop? The large hero images, complex layouts, and subtle animations all come together better on a bigger canvas. Plus, browsing travel destinations on a desktop just feels more immersive - you can really appreciate the details and get lost in the experience.

# What's Inside

The site includes 10 custom-built components and 6 destination pages (Santorini, Dubai, Paris, Bali, Switzerland, and Maldives). Each destination has its own unique vibe with custom color schemes and layouts.

Key features:
- Smooth GSAP animations with scroll triggers
- Glass morphism UI elements
- Floating navbar with destination dropdown
- Instagram-style gallery section
- Interactive hover effects throughout

# Tech Stack

Built with React 19, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS 4. I used GSAP for animations, React Router for navigation, and Vite as the build tool.

# Running Locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Then open http://localhost:5173 in your browser.

# Project Structure

Pretty straightforward - components folder has all the reusable UI pieces, pages folder contains the route components, and assets holds the images. I kept it simple and organized.

# Color Choices

I went with a sophisticated palette - purple as the primary color for that premium feel, blues for trust and adventure, coral for warmth, and charcoal for text. Each destination page also has its own accent color to give it personality.

Typography-wise, I used Great Vibes and Allura for those elegant cursive touches, paired with system fonts for body text to keep things readable.

Built with care and attention to detail. Hope you enjoy exploring it as much as I enjoyed building it.
